                    <p>
						Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become the <em>de facto</em> engines of scientific discovery,
						automation, and economic growth. With rapid advances in large-scale models and accelerated computing, the global technology ecosystem
						continues to shift toward AI-driven workloads. The storage, computation and communication demands for these workloads are increasing
						at an unprecedented pace.
						<br>
						Over the past nine editions, the CogArch workshop has brought together experts exploring novel design ideas for cognitive systems.
						This workshop capitalizes on the synergy between industrial and academic efforts to deepen our understanding of cognitive architectures
						and the key concepts that shape them. <strong>This year’s edition emphasizes the architectural challenges that emerge as large AI models
						scale from single-die systems to multi-chip, multi-node clusters, where performance is increasingly dominated by collective communication
						workloads (e.g., AllReduce, AllGather, ReduceScatter).</strong> As LLMs and multimodal foundation models continue to grow in size and
						complexity, the efficiency of these collective operations becomes a primary limiter of end-to-end performance across training and inference
						pipelines. This shift necessitates architectural innovations at every layer—from chiplets and on-package interconnects to cluster networks,
						memory systems, and software-hardware co-design strategies that accelerate synchronization-heavy computation.
						<br>
						The CogArch workshop solicits formative ideas and new architectural directions for AI systems, with particular focus this year on techniques,
						frameworks, and hardware/software co-design approaches that optimize collective algorithms across chiplets, accelerators, and distributed clusters.
				    </p>
					
					<p>
					<strong>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</strong>
                    <ul class="list-arrow-right">
						<li>Architectures and interconnects optimized for <strong>collective communication</strong> (<em>AllReduce</em>, <em>AllGather</em>, etc.).</li>
						<li><strong>2.5D/3D chiplet technologies</strong> and advanced packaging for scalable multi‑die AI systems.</li>
						<li><strong>Cluster‑level network fabrics</strong> (electrical/optical/hybrid) supporting communication‑bound AI workloads.</li>
